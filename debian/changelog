  * The "I'll finally understand those who curse autotools all day"
    release.

    <string.h>" in the libxml test.  That should prevent any attempt to

    know this is *bad*, but I won't spend more time on this issue, which
    will be fixed the right way when a new release of libxml2 (>= 2.4.20,
    still unreleased) will be installed on his bow when upstream runs
    "aclocal".

  * New upstream release.
  * Ran "srcdir=$PWD gnome-autogen.sh" so that fixes from Debian's libxml2
    autoconf macros are propagated to ./configure, so as to allow building
    on ia64.  Did that with libxml2-dev 2.4.19-4 (needs fix from -2).
    Replaced depcomp symlink with a copy, to please dpkg-source.
