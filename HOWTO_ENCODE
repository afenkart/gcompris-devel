This document describes howto create a localized version of the voices.

1) Create your voices directory
   ----------------------------
First copy the english voices as a template in a new directory with you locale name (e.g. my)
cd boards/voices
cp -r en my

Provide here voice translation in boards/voices/my for each english voice.

2) Recording / Encoding
   --------------------
It is best to choose somebody that speaks and articulate well your language.

- Record with rec, grecord, bcast2000, gnoise, audacity
  (mono wav 16bit/44100Hz gives the best quality/space ratio)

  44100Hz is MANDATORY. On some system with bad supported sound card
  other frequency lead to major troubles.

- Save as WAV file
- Apply loudness transform with sox if necessary.
	You may such script if the sound is too low :
	#!/bin/sh
	mkdir modif
	for i in *.wav; do
	  sox $i -r 44100 -b 16 modif/$i norm
	done

  Here all the normalize voices will be in the directory 'modif'
  just under your current directory.

- In the directory where WAV files are, run:
        oggenc -q0 --downmix -a "(name of author) -d "date of recording" \
               -c "copyright=GPL V3+" *.wav

	ogginfo should display the comment.

- Copy OGG files in the corresponding directory

3) Shipping
   --------
Once done, the easiest way is to tar all this files and send them to the gcompris maintainer.
cd boards/voices
tar -cvzf voices_my.tgz my

4) Integration
   -----------
Nothing has to be done, just run 'make install' at GCompris to level. The voices
will be installed in the proper directory and GCompris will play them.
Run gcompris in your locale and you should ear your voices.

5) Checking
   --------
At top level, run:
./tools/check_missing_voices.pl <locale>

With for example locale being fr for French.
